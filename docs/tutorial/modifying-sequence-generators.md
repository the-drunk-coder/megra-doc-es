# Modifying Sequence Generators

One of MÃ©gra's interesting features is that you can modify the generators themselves, or their execution speed and order, again, both over discrete time (steps) and probabilistically.

For a full list of modifiers that can be applied, see the "Generator Modifiers" section in the function reference.

## apple - probability-based

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t 
  (apple :p 20 (haste 2 0.5) ;; <-- with a probability of 20%, speed up for 2 steps, cut the duration in half
    (cyc 'go "sqr:120 sqr:180 ~ sqr:80")))
```

This only modifies the execution speed. You can also modify execution order.
In the following example, we skip ahead 2 steps with a chance of 9%, or rewind 2 steps with a chance of 10%

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t 
  (apple :p 10 (rewind 2) :p 9 (skip 2) 
    (cyc 'go "sqr:120 sqr:180 ~ sqr:80")))
```

Finally, you can modify the generator itself by adding new information based on its history:

```
(sx 'ba #t
  (apple :p 10 (grow 0.5 :method 'flower) 
    (cyc 'ta "sqr:'c2 sqr:'a3 sqr:'e3 sqr:'f4"))) ;; <-- you can use note names !
```

The 'grow' function takes a sound event from the generator, adds a certain amount of variation (the first argument, wheren 0.0 means no variation and 1.0 means a lot of variation).

Let it run for a while and then check what it looks like:

```
(export-dot "grown" :live 'ba 'ta)
```

## every - step-based

The step-based version actually fills both roles:

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t 
  (every :n 12 (haste 2 0.5) ;; <-- every 12 steps, speed up for 2 steps, cut the duration in half
    (cyc 'go "sqr:120 sqr:180 ~ sqr:80")))
```
