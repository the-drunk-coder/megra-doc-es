# Sound Events, Control Events and Parameters

## Sample Events

Sample events allow you to play a pre-loaded samples, using keywords to specify the sample you need.

### Syntax 

```lisp 
(<sample-type> <keywords> <keyword parameters>)
```

### Example

```lisp
;; choose the 808 sample from the bd folder
(bd 'bd808 :lpf 1000 :rate 0.9)
```

## Live Buffer Events

Live buffer events allow you to play with the live input buffer. The live input buffer is continously recording the last 3 seconds 
(or more or less, if specified at startup) of input of the first input channel. Now there's severaly events that allow you to 
work with it.

### `feedr` - read the live buffer like a regular sample
Using `(feedr)`, you can read from the live buffer directly. All the parameters are the same as in the sample events above. Be careful 
about feedback if you have an open mic !

*Example*:
```lisp
(sx 'ba #t ;; read from live buffer at varying starting points
  (nuc 'fa (feedr :start (bounce 0.01 0.99))))
```

### `freeze` - freeze the live buffer
This event writes the current live buffer (as-is) to a persistent buffer specified by a number, like `(freeze 1)`.
If you use this in a `ctrl` event, you can periodically update the content of the frozen buffer.

```lisp
;; freeze once, to buffer 1
(freeze 1)

;; freeze periodically, every 6 seconds
(sx 'ba #t 
  (nuc 'ta :dur 6000 (ctrl (freeze 1))))
```

### `freezr` - read from frozen buffers
This allows you to read from the buffer previously frozen with `freeze`. You can use it like any regular sample.
First argument specifies the buffer to be read from: `(freezr <bufnum>)`

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t ;; granular sampling on freeze buffer 1 ...
  (nuc 'ba :dur 100 (freezr 1 :start (bounce 0.0 1.0) :atk 1 :sus 100 :rel 100)))
```

## Simple Synth Events

| `:tags`     |none| additional tags |


## Control Events

Control events allow you to schedule parts that you'd otherwise execute manually.

### Example

```lisp
;; Change between two loops 
(sx 'ba #t 
  (infer 'ta :events
    'a (ctrl (sx 'du #t (cyc 'bu "bd ~ sn ~"))) ;; <-- executing the sync context is automated
    'b (ctrl (sx 'du #t (cyc 'bu "cym cym cym cym")))
    :rules 
    (rule 'a 'b 100 1599)
    (rule 'b 'a 100 1599)))
```


## A Note about Note Names
Note names follow the Common Music 2.x convention, where `'a4` is the concert pitch of 440hz, above the *middle c* which is `'c4`. `'cs4` denotes a sharp note, `'cf4` denotes a flat note. The sharp/flat schema is consistent over all notes.

## A Note about Event Tags
Each events contain certain tags by default, such as the event type and the search tags in the case of sample events.
As you might have seen, you can add custom tags. All tags can be used to filter in the respective applicators or modifiers,
as well as to solo and mute in the sync context. Here's an example:

```lisp
(sx 'ba #t :solo 'bass ;; <-- you can solo or block based on the custom tags
	(nuc 'fa (bd :tags 'drums) (sn :tags 'drums) (saw 100 :tags 'bass)))

(sx 'ba #t
	(pear :for 'drums (rev 0.2) ;; <-- only apply reverb to drums
		(nuc 'fa (bd :tags 'drums) (sn :tags 'drums) (saw 100 :tags 'bass))))
```
